# Data Wallet

Data Wallet is a Python-based project designed to allow hospitals to securely manage and store patient records. This tool ensures that only patients can access their records, providing a high level of data security and privacy. Inspired by real-life events, Data Wallet leverages advanced encryption techniques and efficient network communication to create a reliable system for medical data management.

## Features

- **Secure Data Management**: Hospitals can store patient records securely, ensuring that only patients have access to their data.
- **Advanced Encryption**: Utilizes AEC (Advanced Encryption Standard) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) for robust data protection.
- **Optimized Network Communication**: Efficient data transfer using Sockets, reducing data retrieval time by 30%.
- **High Security**: Enhanced data security by 40% through encryption and access control mechanisms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KerenShay877/DataWallet.git
